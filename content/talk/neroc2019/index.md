summary:
abstract: "The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is poised to discover thousands of FRBs over the course of its lifetime, but only has arcminute-scale angular resolution. At the MIT Kavli Institute, we are developing technology and calibration protocols to perform Very Long Baseline Interferometry on FRBs using triggered baseband captures in the 400-800MHz frequency band, enabling precise localizations and multiwavelength followup towards a fuller understanding of this exciting phenomenon. We will report on progress towards demonstrating our VLBI protocol on a 400 meter baseline between CHIME and its predecessor, the CHIME Pathfinder."
