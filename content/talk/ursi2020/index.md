summary:
abstract: "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, brief, extragalactic radio transients. Currently, their progenitors and production mechanism are unknown, and their millisecond-scale duration makes localization for multiwavelength followup extremely challenging. The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment-FRB Instrument [2] leads the field in FRB detection but its arcminute-precision localization is insufficient for host galaxy association. We have devel- oped hardware and software for
CHIME/FRB outrigger telescopes, which will provide more precise localizations through very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). We use the CHIME Pathfinder [1] as an outrigger testbed to demonstrate a synoptic VLBI calibration technique for CHIME/FRB. We demonstrate the interferometric detec- tion of a single FRB between the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and the CHIME Pathfinder while the two telescopes were operating independently and on separate clocks, as in a true VLBI observation. Using a simultaneous observation of the calibrator 3C 305, we measure the FRBâ€™s arrival time difference at the two telescopes with a precision of 15 picoseconds, meeting key hardware, software, and calibration require- ments for performing VLBI with CHIME/FRB outriggers. Such outriggers will enable thousands of FRBs to be localized to milliarcsecond precision, enabling transformative studies of their host environments."
