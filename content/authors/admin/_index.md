Hi! I am a PhD candidate in physics at MIT with research interests in high-energy astrophysics and experimental cosmology. My main PhD work is in turning the CHIME Telescope into a very long baseline interferometry experiment, with the goal of pinpointing the redshift (and the distance) of thousands of fast radio bursts with low latency. Within the CHIME/FRB collaboration I am also leading the search for gravitationally-lensed FRBs using CHIME/FRB data. I used to do optical atomic spectroscopy and experimental quantum optics, but those projects are on the back burner for me indefinitely.
