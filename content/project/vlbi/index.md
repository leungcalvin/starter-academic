The CHIME/FRB collaboration wants to build outriggers on thousand-kilometer baselines for a low-frequency, widefield, blind VLBI survey. This will, at minimum, unlock redshift information for thousands of FRBs, enabling cosmological measurements using FRBs. Within the collaboration I have demonstrated the first interferometric localizations on two fast radio bursts with CHIME telescope over a short baseline with two telescopes, with the goal of the first detection on hundred- and thousand- kilometer baselines within the next year. For our long baseline work we collaborate with Pranav Sanghavi and Kevin Bandura at Green Bank Observatory and Tomas Cassanelli and Keith Vanderlinde at Algonquin Radio Observatory on prototype outriggers.
